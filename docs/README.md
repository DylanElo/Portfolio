# BI Portfolio Documentation Index

This folder now serves as a quick index for the two BI case studies in this portfolio. Detailed documentation lives alongside each project so recruiters and reviewers always see the current source of truth.

## Studio Pierrot Anime Analytics (BI Case Study)
- **Docs:** `projects/studio-pierrot-bi/docs/`
- **Dashboard:** `projects/studio-pierrot-bi/dashboard/index.html`
- **Warehouse & ETL:** See `projects/studio-pierrot-bi/README.md` for the star schema, scripts, and run instructions.

## Japan Inbound Travel Intelligence Hub (BI Capstone)
- **Docs:** `projects/inbound-japan-bi/docs/`
- **Dashboard:** `projects/inbound-japan-bi/dashboard/index.html`
- **Warehouse & ETL:** See `projects/inbound-japan-bi/README.md` for data source notes and step-by-step ETL.

## Why this index exists
The earlier version of this folder duplicated Studio Pierrot docs and linked to deprecated paths. Those files have been removed to reduce confusion. Use the project-level docs above for the latest requirements, strategy, and data model notes.
