# Strategic Document: Studio Pierrot Revitalization Strategy

## 1. Problem Statement
Studio Pierrot, once the undisputed king of shonen anime (Naruto, Bleach), has lost market dominance to newer studios like MAPPA (Jujutsu Kaisen, Chainsaw Man) and ufotable (Demon Slayer).
- **Symptom 1:** Lower average MAL scores for recent productions (6.x vs 8.x for competitors).
- **Symptom 2:** Perception of "quantity over quality" due to long-running series with high filler counts.
- **Symptom 3:** Failure to fully monetize the streaming boom with premium, seasonal releases.

## 2. Strategic Vision
**"From Factory to Boutique"**
Transition from a high-volume, continuous production model to a high-quality, seasonal model for flagship IPs, leveraging the massive legacy fanbase to drive initial momentum.

## 3. Strategic Pillars

### Pillar 1: The "Bleach TYBW" Model
Replicate the success of *Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War* for other legacy IPs (e.g., *Tokyo Ghoul* remake).
- **Action:** Invest in high-budget, seasonal production with top-tier directors.
- **Goal:** Achieve >8.50 MAL score and re-engage lapsed fans.

### Pillar 2: Data-Driven Greenlighting
Use global demand data (Parrot Analytics, MAL) to identify which back-catalog titles have the highest "Revival Potential."
- **Action:** Analyze "Members" vs. "Score" vs. "Recency" to find under-monetized assets.
- **Goal:** Launch one data-backed revival project per year.

### Pillar 3: Streaming Optimization
Shift focus from broadcast TV ratings to global streaming revenue.
- **Action:** Negotiate exclusive or premium licensing deals with Netflix/Crunchyroll based on proven global demand.
- **Goal:** Increase international revenue share to >50% of total studio revenue.

## 4. Roadmap
- **Phase 1 (Analysis):** Build BI dashboard to visualize current portfolio health (Completed).
- **Phase 2 (Pilot):** Greenlight *Tokyo Ghoul: Brotherhood* (hypothetical) based on demand data.
- **Phase 3 (Scale):** Implement "Seasonal" production standard across all new flagship titles.
