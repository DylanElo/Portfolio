# CV / LinkedIn Description - Studio Pierrot BI Project

## Short Version (1 line - for CV skills section)
**Business Intelligence Case Study:** Multi-lens competitive analysis for Studio Pierrot combining real MAL data with simulated industry metrics (Python ETL, SQLite warehouse, interactive dashboards)

## Medium Version (3-4 lines - for CV project section)
**Studio Pierrot Competitive Intelligence Dashboard**  
Built end-to-end BI solution analyzing 25+ anime IPs to identify why Pierrot lags competitors like MAPPA/ufotable. Designed star schema warehouse, Python ETL pipelines (Jikan API + simulated industry data), and multi-tab analytical dashboard. Delivered strategic recommendations on production models, streaming positioning, and IP lifecycle management.

**Tech Stack:** Python • SQLite • Chart.js • HTML/CSS/JS • REST APIs

## Long Version (LinkedIn project description)
**Studio Pierrot Business Intelligence Case Study**

Developed comprehensive BI solution to answer: *Why do Pierrot's flagship IPs (Naruto, Bleach) struggle versus recent hits like Jujutsu Kaisen and Demon Slayer?*

**Scope:**
- Analyzed ~25-30 major anime IPs (2020-2024) across 4 strategic lenses: Global Fandom, Streaming Analytics, Domestic Japan Market, Production Economics
- Combined real MyAnimeList data (Jikan API) with industry-calibrated simulated metrics for streaming demand, TV ratings, BD sales, and production costs

**Technical Implementation:**
- Designed star schema data warehouse (SQLite) with fact/dimension tables for anime metrics, financials, and time-series data
- Built Python ETL pipelines for data ingestion, transformation, and export to dashboard-ready formats
- Created interactive multi-tab dashboard (HTML/CSS/JS + Chart.js) with revenue timeline analysis (2020-2024) and competitive benchmarking

**Business Impact:**
- Identified clear correlation between production model (seasonal vs continuous) and audience reception (filler % inversely correlates with MAL scores)
- Quantified competitive gap: JJK achieves 71.2x demand vs Pierrot's 2-12x on streaming platforms
- Recommended strategic pivot: adopt seasonal production model, cap filler at <10%, invest in premium new IP to compete in streaming era

**Data Transparency:**
- Documented real vs simulated data boundaries and calibration methodology in comprehensive data dictionary
- Separated broadcast status from revenue profiles (e.g., "Naruto = finished airing but legacy evergreen IP with strong long-tail monetization")

**Deliverables:**
- Production-ready dashboard with 5 analytical tabs
- Complete documentation (executive requirements, stakeholder specs, data dictionary, strategic recommendations)
- Tableau-ready CSV exports with visualization suggestions
- GitHub repository with clean code structure and reproducible ETL

## Interview Talking Points

When discussing this project in interviews:

1. **Business Context:** "I wanted to demonstrate end-to-end BI capability, so I chose a real business problem: why Studio Pierrot's anime portfolio underperforms versus competitors like MAPPA."

2. **Data Challenges:** "The challenge was combining real fandom data (MAL API) with realistic business metrics. I simulated streaming, TV ratings, and financials but calibrated them to industry benchmarks like Parrot Analytics' 71.2x demand figure for JJK."

3. **Technical Decisions:** "I chose a star schema because it's industry-standard for BI warehouses, making it easy to slice data by time, anime, or studio. The Python ETL made it reproducible."

4. **Business Impact:** "The analysis revealed clear patterns: seasonal production with <10% filler scores 8.7/10 vs continuous with 42% filler scoring 6.1. That's a actionable insight for production strategy."

5. **Transparency:** "I documented all data limitations upfront—recruiters see I understand the difference between a polished demo and production data quality requirements."

## Recruiter-Facing Summary (Elevator Pitch)

*"I built a complete BI solution analyzing the anime industry, specifically why Studio Pierrot lags behind competitors. I designed a data warehouse, built Python ETL pipelines, and created an interactive dashboard showing revenue trends from 2020-2024. The analysis revealed that production model choice (seasonal vs continuous) directly impacts audience scores—an 8.7 vs 6.1 rating difference. This project demonstrates my ability to handle the full BI workflow: from business requirements and data modeling through ETL and dashboard delivery."*

**Time estimate:** 30 seconds, demonstrates: BI thinking, technical skills, business impact.
