# Inbound BI data artifacts

Raw CSVs, the SQLite warehouse, and dashboard export files are generated by the ETL scripts in `projects/inbound-japan-bi/etl/`.
To avoid binary/large files in Git, these artifacts are ignored and should be produced locally by running the pipeline:

```
cd projects/inbound-japan-bi/etl
python 01_fetch_jnto_arrivals.py
python 02_fetch_fx_rates.py
python 03_fetch_weather_daily.py
python 04_fetch_opensky_flights.py
python 10_build_dimensions.py
python 20_build_fact_inbound_arrivals.py
python 21_build_fact_fx_rates.py
python 22_build_fact_weather.py
python 23_build_fact_flights.py
python 99_export_for_dashboard.py
```

The scripts will recreate the `data/raw` CSVs, `data/inbound_japan.db`, and `dashboard/data/dashboard_data.json` as needed.
